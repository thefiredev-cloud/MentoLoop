# Fix Production Authentication - Action Required

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. **Updated CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN** in Convex to: `https://clerk.sandboxmentoloop.online`
2. **Removed obsolete** `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` environment variable

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Action Required: Update Webhook Secret

The webhook verification is still failing because the Convex webhook secret doesn't match the production Clerk webhook secret.

### Steps to Complete the Fix:

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Select your production application** (sandboxmentoloop.online)
3. **Navigate to Webhooks** in the left sidebar
4. **Find your webhook endpoint** (should point to your Convex URL)
5. **Copy the Signing Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)
6. **Update Convex Environment Variable**:
   - Run this command with your actual webhook secret:
   ```bash
   npx convex env set CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET whsec_YOUR_ACTUAL_PRODUCTION_SECRET
   ```

### Alternative: Using MCP in Claude Code

If you have the webhook secret, you can update it directly through Claude Code:
1. Tell Claude: "Update CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Convex to whsec_[your_actual_secret]"

## üîç Verify the Fix

After updating the webhook secret:

1. **Test Student Sign-up**:
   - Go to https://sandboxmentoloop.online
   - Try creating a new student account
   - Complete the intake form
   - Should submit successfully without errors

2. **Check Convex Logs**:
   - Webhook events should process without "No matching signature found" errors
   - createOrUpdateStudent should succeed

## üìù Current Status

- **CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN**: ‚úÖ Updated to production domain
- **CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET**: ‚ùå Still needs production webhook secret
- **Authentication**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Will work once webhook secret is updated

## üö® Important Notes

- The current webhook secret (`whsec_Sg4CSzoHIFhmaQloK/IprnP5TZCfhEXl`) is for development
- You need the production webhook secret from your Clerk dashboard
- This is a security-sensitive value that only you can access from your Clerk account

## üí° Why This Happened

The production deployment was using development Clerk credentials in Convex, causing:
1. JWT tokens from production Clerk to be rejected
2. Webhooks to fail verification
3. User creation/update operations to fail

Once you update the webhook secret, all authentication should work properly.
