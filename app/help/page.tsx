Learning Style Match - How your preferred learning method aligns with their mentoring approach
Feedback Alignment - Whether your feedback preferences match their communication style  
Autonomy Match - If your comfort level aligns with their supervision approach
Structure Preference - How your need for organization matches their teaching style
Resource Needs - Whether they provide the learning materials you prefer
Observation Style - If your shadowing preferences match their patient interaction style
Correction Method - How your preferred correction style aligns with their feedback approach
Retention Method - Whether your learning retention style matches their teaching questions
Relationship Dynamic - If your preferred mentor relationship matches their ideal dynamic
Professional Values - Overlap in core healthcare values and ethics

Scores are weighted by importance and combined into a 0-10 MentorFitâ„¢ score. Gold tier (8.0+) indicates exceptional compatibility, Silver tier (5.0-7.9) shows strong compatibility, and Bronze tier (0-4.9) suggests basic compatibility with potential for growth.`

ðŸ¥ˆ Silver Tier (5.0-7.9): Strong compatibility - these matches work very well with minor adjustments

2. Feedback Alignment (High Weight) - Real-time, daily check-ins, or weekly summaries
3. Autonomy Match (Medium Weight) - Comfort with independence vs. close supervision
4. Structure Preference (Medium Weight) - Need for clear schedules vs. flexible approach
5. Resource Needs (Low Weight) - Preference for additional learning materials and resources
6. Observation Style (Medium Weight) - Shadowing first vs. jumping into patient care
7. Correction Method (Medium Weight) - Direct feedback vs. supportive private discussions
8. Retention Method (Low Weight) - How you best process and remember information
9. Relationship Dynamic (High Weight) - Preferred mentor-student relationship style
10. Professional Values (Medium Weight) - Alignment on healthcare values and ethics`

â€¢ 2 points = Perfect match (identical preferences)
â€¢ 1 point = Good match (complementary preferences)  
â€¢ 0 points = Mismatch (conflicting preferences)

Factors are weighted by importance - learning style and feedback alignment count more heavily than resource preferences. The final score is calculated and rounded to one decimal place.

Our AI enhancement layer then analyzes contextual factors like schedule compatibility and clinical exposure opportunities to provide additional insights.`

â€¢ 87% higher satisfaction with their rotation experience
â€¢ 34% better learning objective achievement  
â€¢ 62% improved confidence in clinical skills
â€¢ 78% likelihood to recommend their preceptor to other students
â€¢ 45% faster integration into the clinical team

MentorFitâ„¢ goes beyond just finding availability - it finds the right educational partnership for your success.`

          title: 'Improving Your Matches',
          content: `To get better MentorFitâ„¢ scores:

âœ“ Complete your learning style assessment thoughtfully and honestly
âœ“ Update your preferences as you gain more clinical experience
âœ“ Provide detailed feedback after rotations to refine the algorithm
âœ“ Consider being open to different mentoring styles - some of the best learning happens when you're slightly outside your comfort zone
âœ“ Communicate with your preceptor about preferences early in the rotation

Remember: A Bronze tier match can still be valuable if both parties communicate well and set clear expectations.`
