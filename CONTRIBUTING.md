# Contributing to MentoLoop

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MentoLoop! This healthcare mentorship platform relies on community contributions to improve the educational experience for nursing students and preceptors.

## üè• About MentoLoop

MentoLoop is a HIPAA-compliant platform designed specifically for healthcare education, connecting nursing students with experienced preceptors through AI-powered matching and comprehensive clinical placement management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (recommended for optimal performance)
- Git for version control
- A Clerk account for authentication testing
- A Convex account for database development

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MentoLoop.git
   cd MentoLoop
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Fill in your development environment variables
   ```

3. **Start Development Servers**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Next.js development server
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2: Convex development server  
   npx convex dev
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Check that authentication works
   - Verify database connection

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All new code must be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Run `npm run lint` before committing
- **Prettier**: Code formatting is handled automatically
- **Convex**: Database operations must use Convex functions

### Convex Development Patterns

- **Actions vs Mutations**: Use actions for external API calls, mutations for database operations
- **Hook Usage**: Use `useAction` for external operations, `useMutation` for database changes
- **Internal Actions**: Follow the `sendEmailInternal` pattern for reusable internal operations
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for all operations
- **Email Integration**: Use the internal action pattern for all email operations

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with React hooks
- Follow the existing shadcn/ui component patterns
- **Always provide unique keys** for ScrollArea and dynamic list components
- Maintain accessibility standards (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Ensure responsive design (mobile-first approach)
- Use proper React key patterns to prevent rendering issues

### Healthcare Data Compliance

- **HIPAA Compliance**: Never log or expose personal health information
- **FERPA Compliance**: Student educational records must be protected
- **Data Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Audit Logging**: Use the audit logging system for sensitive operations

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test:unit

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Integration tests  
npm run test:integration

# All tests
npm run test:all
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Use Vitest for component and utility function testing
- **E2E Tests**: Use Playwright for full user journey testing
- **Integration Tests**: Test Convex function integrations
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage for new features

### Test Guidelines

- Test user workflows, not implementation details
- Mock external services (SendGrid, Twilio, OpenAI)
- Include accessibility tests
- Test error handling and edge cases
- **Email System**: Test internal action patterns and template rendering
- **React Components**: Test component key handling and re-rendering behavior
- **Convex Functions**: Test action vs mutation separation and error handling

## üìù Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Branch Naming**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/ai-matching-improvements
   git checkout -b fix/student-dashboard-bug
   git checkout -b docs/update-api-documentation
   ```

2. **Code Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   npm run lint          # ESLint validation
   npm run type-check    # TypeScript compilation
   npm run build         # Production build test
   npm run test:unit:run # Unit test validation
   ```
   
   **Additional Checks for New Patterns:**
   - Verify proper use of `useAction` vs `useMutation`
   - Ensure ScrollArea components have unique keys
   - Test email system with internal action patterns
   - Validate error handling in Convex functions

3. **Manual Testing**
   - Test the feature in both student and preceptor roles
   - Verify mobile responsiveness
   - Check accessibility with screen readers
   - Test with various data scenarios

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **Clear Title**: Describe what the PR accomplishes
- **Detailed Description**: Explain the problem and solution
