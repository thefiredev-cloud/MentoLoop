# Production Deployment Fix Summary
Date: August 31, 2025

## Issue
The production site at sandboxmentoloop.online was showing payment processing errors on Step 4 of the student intake form, while the local development server was working correctly.

## Root Cause
Netlify was not automatically deploying the latest commits from GitHub. The production deployment was 2 commits behind the main branch, missing critical Stripe payment fixes.

### Missing Commits on Production:
1. `841e56c` - Discount code support for student intake payments
2. `44e1527` - TypeScript error fix in discount validation

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Identified Deployment Gap
- Local repository had all fixes pushed to GitHub
- Netlify last deployed commit `0fe430e` (Clerk JWT fix)
- Production was missing the discount code support and payment fixes

### 2. Fixed TypeScript Build Error
- Error in `convex/payments.ts` line 1139: Optional `args.email` type issue
- Added non-null assertion operator (!) inside conditional block
- Committed fix: `44e1527`

### 3. Manual Netlify Deployment
- Linked local directory to Netlify site: `01cdb350-d5be-422e-94f8-be47973d6c13`
- Triggered manual production deployment
- Build completed successfully in 1m 20.6s

### 4. Verification
- Production URL: https://sandboxmentoloop.online
- Student intake form loading correctly
- No console errors
- Payment processing functionality restored

## Key Learnings

1. **Monitor Automatic Deployments**: Netlify webhooks may occasionally fail. Set up notifications for failed deployments.

2. **TypeScript Strictness**: Build-time TypeScript errors can block deployments even if local dev works.

3. **Manual Deploy Command**: 
   ```bash
   npx netlify-cli link --id [site-id]
   npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --message "Deployment message"
   ```

## Current Production Status
✅ All Stripe payment fixes deployed
✅ Discount code support active
✅ Student intake form fully functional
✅ No runtime errors

## Next Steps
- Monitor Netlify webhook reliability
- Consider adding build status badge to repository
- Set up deployment notifications in Netlify dashboard

## Deployed Commits
- Latest production commit: `44e1527`
- Includes all payment processing fixes from last night's debugging session
- Discount code functionality (including NP12345 100% off code)
