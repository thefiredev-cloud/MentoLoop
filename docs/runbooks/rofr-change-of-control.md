# ROFR / Change-of-Control Awareness Memo

**Purpose:** Outline the operational steps to satisfy the right-of-first-refusal (ROFR) and change-of-control notice obligations without providing legal advice.

## Triggering Events
- Planned sale of substantially all assets.
- Merger in which voting control shifts.
- Equity issuance that hands majority control to a new party.

When any trigger is contemplated, immediately notify the executive sponsor and legal counsel.

## Step-by-Step Checklist

1. **Internal Intake**
   - Document triggering event summary, proposed timing, and counterparties.
   - Assign internal owner (COO/CEO) and legal lead.

2. **Contract Review**
   - Retrieve executed Exhibit G (ROFR) and main agreement from secure contract vault.
   - Confirm notice period (e.g., 30 days) and acceptance mechanics (email vs. certified mail).

3. **Draft ROFR Notice**
   - Include: description of offer, material terms, deadline for exercise, contact information.
   - Attach supporting documentation (term sheet, LOI) per contract requirements.
   - Have counsel review the draft prior to delivery.

4. **Serve Notice**
   - Deliver to the partner using the contract-specified method (email + certified mail recommended).
   - Log delivery proof (postal receipt, email timestamp) in the deal folder.

5. **Track Response Window**
   - Set calendar reminders for deadline minus 5 days, minus 2 days, and final day.
   - If partner exercises ROFR, coordinate deal execution. If declined or period lapses, proceed with original transaction.

6. **Change-of-Control Filing**
   - Submit change-of-control notice in parallel (even if ROFR waived) including:
     - Effective date
     - Description of new controlling party
     - Statement that all obligations remain in force
   - Record acknowledgement from partner.

7. **Post-Closing Update**
   - Update Cap Table / corporate records.
   - Notify internal stakeholders (finance, security, customer success) of new ownership structure.

## Communication Guidelines
- All external communication flows through counsel and the executive sponsor.
- Do not disclose deal pricing externally unless the ROFR requires it.
- Maintain confidentiality consistent with NDAs and data room access controls.

## Document Retention
- Store notices, proofs of delivery, and partner responses in the legal share with naming format `YYYY-MM-DD_ROFR_notice.pdf`.
- Retain for minimum 7 years.

For any ambiguity, escalate to legal counsel. This memo is operational guidance, not legal opinion.
