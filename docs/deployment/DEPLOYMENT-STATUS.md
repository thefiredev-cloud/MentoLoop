## ⚠️ Important Notes for Client

### Production Deployment Requirements
1. **Domain & Hosting**: Deploy to Vercel or Netlify
2. **Environment Variables**: Update all URLs from localhost to production domain
3. **Webhook Configuration**:
   - Stripe: Set webhook endpoint to `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
   - Clerk: Set webhook to Convex HTTP endpoint
4. **Email Domain**: Verify sender domain in SendGrid
5. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is configured

### Current Limitations
1. **Payments**: Using direct Stripe integration (not Clerk Billing)
2. **Location**: Currently restricted to Texas operations
3. **AI Matching**: Optional feature (can be disabled)
4. **Enterprise Features**: Basic implementation only

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start development servers
npm run dev          # Next.js app on http://localhost:3000
npx convex dev      # Convex backend (run in separate terminal)
