This Software Development and Revenue Sharing Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into as of 
________________, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), by and between TheFireDev LLC, a California limited 
liability company (“Developer”), with its principal place of business as set forth in Exhibit C; and 
Mentoloop, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Company”), with its principal place of business as set 
forth in Exhibit C. 

RECITALS 

WHEREAS, Developer has designed, developed, deployed, and continues to refine a healthcare clinical 
placement platform for Company, including (without limitation) the site located at 
sandboxmentoloop.online and its successor primary domain mentoloop.com (together, the “Platform”); 

WHEREAS, the Platform incorporates advanced technologies including AI‑powered matching, real‑time 
database architecture, authentication, billing, and third‑party integrations, and is configured to support 
Company’s HIPAA compliance obligations; and Company shall remain solely responsible for all 
legal/regulatory compliance (including HIPAA), Business Associate Agreements, and operational 
safeguards; 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to document compensation for work performed to date and to establish a 
limited‑term revenue sharing arrangement while Company scales the Platform; and 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein, the parties agree as follows: 

1. COMPLETED WORK; VERSION 1.0 SCOPE 

1.1 Acknowledgment. Company acknowledges delivery of a functional Platform including source code,

configuration, and related materials. The Platform includes, without limitation: Next.js 15 application, 
Convex database, Clerk authentication, AI integrations (OpenAI and Google Gemini), SendGrid/Twilio, 
and associated front‑ and back‑end components. 

1.2 Version 1.0 Hardening & Acceptance. Developer will perform reasonable stabilization to reach 
Version 1.0 (“v1.0”) as defined in Exhibit D. Upon the earlier of (a) Company’s written acceptance that 
v1.0 criteria are met; or (b) five (5) business days after production deployment that materially satisfies 
Exhibit D with no Sev‑1 defects blocking core flows, the work is deemed Accepted. After Acceptance, 
Developer has no ongoing obligation to provide development, maintenance, or support unless 
separately agreed in writing. 

1.3 Domain Transfers. Upon receipt of the §2.1 Initial Payment, Developer shall cooperate to transfer 
sandboxmentoloop.online to Company’s registrar of choice and complete DNS cutover for 
mentoloop.com as the primary domain (details in Exhibit D). Company will bear registrar/DNS fees. 

1.4 Background IP. As between the parties, Developer retains all right, title, and interest in Developer’s 
pre‑existing tools, libraries, templates, frameworks, know‑how, and generic components (“Background 
IP”). Subject to §2.1 payment, Developer grants Company a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, 
royalty‑free license to use Background IP solely as incorporated into or necessary to operate the 
Platform. 

1.5 Third‑Party Services & Open Source. Company shall maintain its own accounts and licenses 
(including OpenAI, Google, Stripe, Clerk, Convex, SendGrid, Twilio, hosting, and observability) and 
comply with applicable third‑party terms and open‑source licenses. Developer makes no warranty 
regarding third‑party services. 

1.6 Payment Processing (Stripe / Clerk Billing). 

(a) Accounts & Control. Company will operate payment processing under a Company‑owned Stripe 
account and/or Clerk Billing linked to Company’s Stripe. All products, prices, refunds, chargebacks, tax 
settings, payout schedules, and platform/Connect settings (if used) are Company‑controlled. 

(b) No Funds Handling by Developer. Developer does not accept, hold, process, or settle end‑user 
payments, is not a merchant of record, and is not responsible for Stripe balances, payouts, reserves, 
chargebacks, or card‑network fines. 

(c) PCI & Data Handling. The Platform shall use Stripe‑hosted Checkout/Elements or Clerk‑hosted 
components such that card data is not handled by Developer systems. Company is responsible for its 
PCI‑DSS obligations (e.g., SAQ‑A) and for ensuring no PHI is transmitted to Stripe except as consistent 
with Company’s compliance program. 

(d) Webhooks. Company will provide secrets and endpoints for production webhooks. The Platform will

verify signatures and handle at minimum: checkout.session.completed, 
payment_intent.succeeded, charge.refunded, and charge.dispute.created (see 
Exhibit F). Company is responsible for operational response to disputes and refunds. 

(e) Taxes & Receipts. Company is solely responsible for tax collection/remittance (e.g., Stripe Tax if 
enabled), invoicing, and customer receipts. 

(f) Handover. Prior to v1.0 Acceptance, Developer will document Stripe/Clerk keys, environment 
variables, and webhook endpoints and confirm a successful live‑mode test transaction. 

2. COMPENSATION 

2.1 Initial Payment (Revised). Within five (5) business days of execution, Company shall pay Developer a 
one‑time payment of US $40,000.00 by wire/ACH. This recognizes work performed since July 1, 2025 
and is non‑refundable. Late amounts accrue interest at 1.0% per month or the maximum lawful rate, 
whichever is lower, until paid. 

2.2 Revenue Share (Tiers). For five (5) years from the Effective Date, Company shall pay Developer a 
percentage of Gross Revenue (defined in §2.3) on an annual basis, paid quarterly per §2.4: 

●  Up to and including $1,000,000 annual Gross Revenue: 40% 

●  Over $1,000,000 and up to and including $3,000,000: 25% 
●  Over $3,000,000: 15% 

2.3 Gross Revenue; Anti‑Avoidance. “Gross Revenue” means all revenue collected by Company or its 
Affiliates, successors, assigns, licensees, resellers, or white‑label partners from any source directly or 
indirectly related to the Platform or any successor, rebrand, derivative work, or substantially similar 
offering, including subscription fees, transaction fees, licensing, partnership revenues, data 
access/monetization, and advertising, excluding only (a) taxes collected/remitted; and (b) 
refunds/chargebacks. Company shall not structure arrangements with the primary purpose to reduce 
amounts payable hereunder; intercompany/affiliate transactions must be arm’s‑length at fair‑market 
value. 

2.4 Statements; Payment Mechanics. Revenue‑share amounts shall be calculated and paid quarterly 
within thirty (30) days after each calendar quarter. Quarterly payments are calculated on a cumulative 
YTD basis with a Q4 true‑up to reflect tier thresholds; prior payments are credited. Each payment shall 
include a written statement showing Gross Revenue and applicable tier. On request, Company will 
provide links/read‑only access to Stripe (or Clerk/Stripe) dashboards and accounting reports reasonably

necessary to validate statements. All payments via ACH/wire to Developer’s account in Exhibit A. Late 
payments accrue interest per §2.1. 

2.5 Cap and Company Buy‑Out. Revenue‑share obligations continue until the earlier of: (a) five (5) years 
from the Effective Date; or (b) the date cumulative revenue‑share payments to Developer equal US 
$600,000 (the “Cap”). Company may at any time buy out the remaining obligation by paying the 
difference between the Cap and all revenue‑share paid to date (the “Buy‑Out Amount”). Conditions 
precedent: (i) Company has paid all accrued amounts (including interest); (ii) Company is not in uncured 
material breach; and (iii) Company (and any acquirer/assignee) acknowledges compliance with §§2.4–3 
through the buy‑out closing. Upon Developer’s receipt of the Cap or Buy‑Out Amount, §§2.2–3 and §5.2 
terminate; accrued but unpaid amounts remain due. 

3. REPORTING AND AUDIT RIGHTS 

3.1 Reporting & Access. Company shall maintain accurate and complete books/records relating to Gross 
Revenue and retain them for seven (7) years. Within thirty (30) days after each quarter, Company will 
provide the statement described in §2.4 and, upon reasonable request, read‑only access to payment 
processor dashboards (e.g., Stripe), subscription analytics, and accounting reports sufficient to validate 
Gross Revenue. 

3.2 Audit. No more than once per calendar year, upon fifteen (15) business days’ notice, Developer may 
audit records relevant to Gross Revenue during normal business hours. If an audit reveals an 
underpayment exceeding five percent (5%) for any audited period, Company shall promptly pay the 
shortfall, interest per §2.1, and Developer’s reasonable audit costs. 

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 

4.1 Ownership of Deliverables. Upon receipt of the §2.1 Initial Payment, Company owns all intellectual 
property rights in the Platform deliverables as provided by Developer, excluding the Background IP 
licensed under §1.4. Ownership remains subject to Developer’s revenue‑share, audit, and portfolio 
rights. 

4.2 Developer Portfolio Rights. Developer may reference the Platform in its portfolio, marketing 
materials, and professional representations, and may use non‑confidential descriptions and screenshots 
for such purposes. 

4.3 Limited Moral Rights Waiver. To the limited extent necessary for Company to use, modify, and

distribute the Platform, Developer waives moral rights; nothing limits Developer’s §4.2 portfolio rights. 

5. SUCCESSOR & ACQUISITION PROVISIONS 

5.1 Binding on Successors; Assignment. This Agreement binds and benefits the parties and their 
successors/permitted assigns. Company may not assign without Developer’s prior written consent, 
except in a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets, provided the acquirer expressly 
assumes all obligations, including revenue‑share and audit rights. 

5.2 Acceleration on Change of Control. Upon any Change of Control (more than 50% ownership change 
or sale of substantially all assets), at Developer’s option: (a) the revenue‑share continues on existing 
terms; or (b) Company shall pay a lump sum equal to 2.5× the Reference Annual Revenue Share (the 
greater of: last full quarter’s revenue‑share × 4; or average monthly revenue‑share over the last six (6) 
months × 12). The lump sum is due at closing and must be funded from proceeds or placed in escrow for 
Developer’s benefit. 

5.3 Right of First Refusal on Platform Disposition. 

(a) Triggered Transactions. For so long as any obligations under §§2.2–3 or §5.2 remain in effect, 
Company shall not consummate any Disposition of the Platform or any material portion of the Platform 
IP to a third party, other than a Permitted Transfer, unless it has first complied with this §5.3. 
“Disposition” includes any sale, assignment, exclusive license, transfer, or other conveyance of ownership 
or exclusive exploitation rights. 

(b) Notice of Bona Fide Offer. If Company receives a bona fide written third‑party offer to effect a 
Disposition that Company desires to accept (the “Offer”), Company shall deliver to Developer a notice 
setting forth the identity of the offeror and all material terms including price and any non‑cash 
consideration, escrow/holdbacks, assumed liabilities, and closing conditions, together with a redacted 
term sheet or draft agreement sufficient to evaluate the Offer. 

(c) Exercise. Developer shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (the “ROFR Period”) to elect 
to purchase or license on the same terms by written notice to Company. If the Offer includes non‑cash 
consideration, Developer may elect to pay the cash equivalent of such consideration at fair market value. 
Closing shall occur within forty‑five (45) days after exercise, subject to customary definitive agreements. 

(d) Failure to Exercise. If Developer does not timely exercise, Company may consummate the Disposition 
with the identified offeror on terms no more favorable to such offeror than those set forth in the notice

Effective: [___________, 2025]  |  Version: v2.5 (2025-09-15)  |  Doc ID: TFD-ML-RevShare-v2 

and with a closing within one hundred twenty (120) days; otherwise, the Disposition shall again be 
subject to this §5.3. 

(e) Permitted Transfers. The foregoing shall not apply to (i) internal reorganizations or transfers for bona 
fide financing purposes in which, after the transaction, Company (or its successor) remains obligated 
under this Agreement; (ii) liens or security interests granted in the ordinary course; (iii) non‑exclusive 
licenses in the ordinary course; or (iv) a Change of Control transaction, provided that at closing Company 
complies with §5.2 or, if §2.5 has been satisfied prior to closing, the acquirer assumes any surviving 
obligations under §§2.3 and 3 through closing. 

(f) Confidentiality; No‑Shop. During the ROFR Period, each party shall keep Offer terms confidential, and 
Company shall not solicit or shop alternative offers. 

(g) Sunset. This §5.3 terminates upon Company’s satisfaction of §2.5 (Cap or Buy‑Out). 

(h) Packaged Deals. If an Offer is bundled with other assets or businesses, the parties shall in good faith 
allocate a price to the Platform and related Platform IP. If they cannot agree within ten (10) days, the 
allocation shall be determined by an independent valuation firm mutually selected (or, failing 
agreement, appointed by AAA) and split equally. Developer may exercise this §5.3 with respect to the 
Platform at the allocated price. 

5.4 (Optional) Right of First Offer on Post‑Acceptance Engineering. 

For twelve (12) months following v1.0 Acceptance, before engaging any third‑party to perform material 
feature development, refactoring, or re‑platforming work on the Platform reasonably estimated to 
exceed forty (40) engineer hours or US $25,000 in fees, Company shall first offer such work to Developer 
including a reasonable statement of scope. Developer shall have ten (10) business days to submit a 
good‑faith proposal. If the parties do not execute a statement of work within fifteen (15) business days 
after Developer’s proposal, Company may engage a third‑party on terms not materially less favorable to 
Company than those offered to Developer. 

6. REPRESENTATIONS; INDEMNITIES; LIMITATIONS 

6.1 Developer Representations. Developer has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and, 
to Developer’s knowledge, the deliverables as provided do not infringe third‑party IP rights. 

6.2 Company Representations. Company has full right and authority to enter into this Agreement and 
will operate the Platform in good faith to maximize revenue potential and comply with applicable laws 
and third‑party terms.

EXHIBIT B — Revenue Share Examples & True‑Up 

Updated for §2.2 (40% / 25% / 15% tiers) and §2.5 Cap/Buy‑Out (Cap: $600,000; 5‑year term). 

Scenario 1 — $600,000 Annual Gross Revenue. 

40% × $600,000 = $240,000 total for the year. Illustrative equal quarters: ~$60,000/quarter, with minor 
year‑end true‑up. 

Scenario 2 — $1,800,000 Annual Gross Revenue. 

(40% × $1,000,000) + (25% × $800,000) = $400,000 + $200,000 = $600,000. Cap is reached during the 
year; quarterly payments stop in the quarter when cumulative YTD payments hit $600,000. No further 
revenue‑share is owed thereafter. 

Scenario 3 — $3,500,000 Annual Gross Revenue. 

Without the Cap: (40% × $1,000,000) + (25% × $2,000,000) + (15% × $500,000) = $975,000. With the 
Cap: payments cease once cumulative payments equal $600,000 (reached before year‑end). 

Refunds/Chargebacks Example. 

If $25,000 in refunds post in Q3, Gross Revenue is reduced accordingly and any overpayment is credited 
in the next statement. If the Cap has already been reached, statements should still reflect netting, but no 
additional payment is due. 

Affiliate/White‑Label Example. 

Revenue collected by a rebranded affiliate (e.g., a partner school) counts toward Gross Revenue; 
arm’s‑length pricing is required (§2.3).

Buy‑Out Example. 

If cumulative revenue‑share paid to date is $180,000, the Buy‑Out Amount is $420,000 (Cap $600,000 
minus $180,000), subject to §2.5 conditions precedent. Upon payment, §§2.2–3 and §5.2 terminate. 

Change of Control Note. 

If the Cap or Buy‑Out has been satisfied prior to a Change of Control, §5.2 acceleration 
no longer applies per §2.5.
